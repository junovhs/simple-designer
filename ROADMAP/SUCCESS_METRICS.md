## Success Metrics

### Performance Targets
- [ ] **60 FPS Interaction:** All canvas operations (panning, zooming, transforming objects) must maintain 60 FPS with 10,000 objects visible on screen.
- [ ] **Fast Document Load:** Open documents with 1,000 layers and embedded images in <100ms.
- [ ] **Efficient Render Loop:** The time budget for a single frame (update, cull, render) must not exceed 16ms to guarantee 60 FPS.
- [ ] **Instant Startup:** The application's cold start time (from launch to interactive) must be <1 second on modern hardware.
- [ ] **GPU Throughput:** The core instanced rendering pipeline must be able to draw 10,000 unique rectangles in <5ms.

### Quality Targets
- [ ] **Zero Warnings:** The entire Rust and TypeScript codebase must compile with zero warnings under the strictest linter settings.
- [ ] **100% Mandate Compliance:** All code must adhere to the `CODE_WITH_INTENT` principles without exception.
- [ ] **Test Coverage:** All core Rust logic (data structures, commands, transformations) must have comprehensive unit tests. All major user workflows must be covered by Tauri integration tests.
- [ ] **Cross-Platform Parity:** All features must work identically and reliably across all Tier 1 platforms. Any platform-specific bugs must be documented and triaged.

### Platform Compatibility Targets
- [ ] **Tier 1 (Full Support & Testing):** Windows 10/11 (x64), macOS 11+ (Apple Silicon & Intel), Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. Builds are automatically tested and released for these platforms.
- [ ] **Tier 2 (Best Effort):** Other major Linux distributions (e.g., Fedora, Arch). The application is expected to build and run, but issues are lower priority.

### User Experience Targets
- [ ] **Sub-Second Load Time:** Application startup should feel instantaneous.
- [ ] **Offline First:** The application must be 100% functional without an internet connection.
- [ ] **Responsive UI:** All UI interactions (clicking buttons, dragging sliders, opening panels) must have <100ms latency to feel immediate. No jank.
- [ ] **Export Fidelity:** Exported files (PNG, JPG, SVG, PDF) must be pixel-perfect representations of the canvas, with correct dimensions, colors, and metadata.
- [ ] **Keyboard-First Workflow:** Every single action available in the UI must be triggerable via a keyboard shortcut or the command palette, enabling power users to work without touching the mouse.
